                        <p>Due to the fact that I was a scholar of Turkish government during my graduate study at CMU, I had to fulfill a service in return after finishing my program. This fulfillment was assigned to me as a service at a university and I was a research assistant at Computer &amp; Instructional Technology department in Faculty of Education at Rize University.</p>
                        <p>I contributed to many daily tasks and implemented some automation scripts to overcome these. These tasks included planning, scheduling and organizing midterm and final exam sessions in the faculty for a given limited time and resource like classrooms and staff. I developed a web application which had a scheduling logic built with Laravel framework as a proof of concept but the project was not funded.</p>
                        <p>In addition, I developed a cross-platform mobile application for an international symposium held at the university. Apart from these, I was also a teaching assistant in several classes such as Introduction to Programming, DBMS and Hands On: Google Services</p>
